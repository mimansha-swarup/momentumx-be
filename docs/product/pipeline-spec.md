# Pipeline Status Model

Finalized spec for how status is tracked across the MomentumX pipeline. All decisions here are locked — do not change without a product discussion.

---

## The Pipeline

```
Research → Script → Hooks → Packaging
```

**Strictly sequential.** Each step depends on the data output of the previous:

- Script requires: selected topic
- Hooks requires: script
- Packaging requires: script + title + selectedHook

There is no shortcut path from Research to Packaging — the data dependencies enforce the order.

---

## 3-Level Status Tracking

Status exists at three levels simultaneously:

```
Level 1: Dashboard          — all video projects at a glance
Level 2: Per-video tracker  — which step the video is currently at, overall progress
Level 3: Per-step status    — what's happening inside the current step
```

### Level 1 — Dashboard

Shows all of the creator's video projects. Each row shows:
- Video working title
- Current pipeline step (Research / Script / Hooks / Packaging)
- Top-level status (In Progress / Needs Review / Done)

### Level 2 — Per-video Tracker

Inside a single video project. Shows the four pipeline steps as a progress indicator. Each step shows whether it's completed, in progress, or not started.

The creator can navigate back to any completed step to review or regenerate content.

### Level 3 — Per-step Status

What's happening inside an individual step. State machine per step — see schemas below.

---

## Step State Machines

### Research Step

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `not_started` | No generation has run |
| `in_progress` | AI generating or awaiting creator selection |
| `completed` | Creator has selected a topic |
| `stale` | Downstream change invalidated context |

**Trigger table:**

| Action | Transition |
|---|---|
| Creator initiates topic generation | `not_started` → `in_progress` |
| Creator selects a topic | `in_progress` → `completed` |
| Creator regenerates (Regenerate All) | `completed` → `in_progress` |
| Creator regenerates (Regenerate All) | `in_progress` → `in_progress` |

**Note on stale:** If Script is regenerated, Research step itself is NOT marked stale. Research is upstream — Script being redone doesn't change the topic decision.

---

### Script Step

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `not_started` | No script generated yet |
| `in_progress` | Script generating or awaiting creator approval |
| `completed` | Creator has marked the script done |
| `stale` | Downstream change invalidated context |

**Trigger table:**

| Action | Transition |
|---|---|
| Creator initiates script generation | `not_started` → `in_progress` |
| Creator marks script done | `in_progress` → `completed` |
| Creator regenerates | any → `in_progress` |

**Stale:** If script is regenerated while Hooks or Packaging exist downstream, those steps have `status` set to `"stale"`.

---

### Hooks Step

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `not_started` | No hooks generated yet |
| `in_progress` | Hooks generating or awaiting creator selection |
| `completed` | Creator has selected a hook |
| `stale` | Upstream script was regenerated |

**Trigger table:**

| Action | Transition |
|---|---|
| Creator triggers hook generation | `not_started` → `in_progress` |
| Creator selects a hook | `in_progress` → `completed` |
| Creator regenerates | any → `in_progress` |
| Script is regenerated upstream | any → `stale` |

**Completion mechanic:** Selecting a hook = completing the hooks step. The selected hook index is stored on the video project as `selectedHookIndex`. This feeds the Packaging step.

**Stale:** If hooks are regenerated while Packaging exists downstream, Packaging has `status` set to `"stale"`.

---

### Packaging Step

The packaging pipeline step uses `StepState` like all other steps. Per-item status is tracked on the **packaging document itself** (not on the video project), using `itemStatuses`.

**Packaging items:**
- Title variations
- Description
- Thumbnail brief
- Shorts script

**Per-item status (on packaging document):**

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `not_started` | Not yet generated |
| `completed` | Item has been generated (via save or regenerate) |
| `stale` | Upstream script or hooks were regenerated — item is out of date |

**Status auto-advances to `completed`** when content is saved or regenerated. Three states only — no `in_progress` at the item level.

**Trigger table (per item):**

| Action | Transition |
|---|---|
| `savePackaging` with item content present | `not_started` → `completed` |
| `regenerateItem` succeeds | any → `completed` |
| Upstream script regenerated | `completed` → `stale` (skips `not_started`) |
| Upstream hooks regenerated | `completed` → `stale` (skips `not_started`) |

**Document-level stale fields:**

| Field | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `isStale: boolean` | `true` if any item is `"stale"` |
| `staleReason: "script_regenerated" \| "hooks_regenerated" \| null` | What caused the stale cascade |
| `staleSince: Timestamp \| null` | When the cascade happened |

When the last stale item is regenerated, `isStale`, `staleReason`, and `staleSince` are all cleared.

---

## Stale Model

Stale is represented as a **status value**, not a separate boolean field. A stale step has:

```
step.status = "stale"
```

This means `status` can be `"not_started" | "in_progress" | "completed" | "stale"`. There is no separate `stale: boolean` field — the stale state replaces the status value.

### Stale Cascade Rules

| What changes | What goes stale |
|---|---|
| Script regenerated | Hooks step, Packaging step |
| Hook selection changes | Packaging step |
| Research topic changes (Regenerate All) | Script step, Hooks step, Packaging step |

### Stale Resolution

When a creator visits a stale step, the UI warns them:
- "This was generated with an older version of your script. Regenerate to update."

Creator options:
- Regenerate (clears stale, re-runs generation with new context)
- Keep as-is (stale flag cleared — creator acknowledged and accepted the content)

---

## Regeneration Behavior

### Regenerate All

Replaces the entire current batch of generated items. Old batch is **archived** (not deleted). Used when the creator wants a completely fresh set of ideas.

- Triggers: `any status` → `generating`
- Old items: `archived: true` on all documents in the old batch
- New batch gets a new `batchId`
- Stale cascade fires on downstream steps

### Regenerate One

Replaces a single item in the current batch (slot-replace). The slot position is preserved — the new item appears in the same position as the one being replaced.

- Triggers: that item's status → `generating`
- Other items in batch: unaffected
- No batch ID change
- Stale cascade: does NOT fire (same step, same item slot)

---

## Batch Retention Policy

**Decision: Keep archived batches forever (no cleanup in Phase 0).**

Rationale:
1. **KMeans clustering actively benefits from archived batches.** `getAllTopicTitles()` queries all topic documents for a user — including archived ones. More historical titles = better clustering = less repetitive suggestions in future generations.
2. **No users yet.** Storage cost is not a real concern at current scale.
3. **No cleanup logic needed.** Anything beyond "keep forever" requires TTLs, batch counters, or Cloud Functions — all out of scope for Phase 0.
4. **Easily revisited.** Add `expiresAt` or a cleanup job when it becomes a real problem (thousands of users, tens of thousands of archived topics per user).

---

## Concurrent Video Projects

A creator can have multiple video projects active simultaneously. Each video project is independent — status transitions on one do not affect any other. There is no cross-project KMeans context — clustering is already per-user globally.

---

## Firestore Schema

### New Collection: `videoProjects`

```
videoProjects/{videoProjectId}
  projectId: string           // same as Firestore doc ID, stored for queries
  userId: string              // owner — always filter by this first
  title: string               // working title (from selected topic)
  topicId: string             // ref to topics collection
  scriptId: string | null     // ref to scripts collection
  hooksId: string | null      // ref to hooks collection
  packagingId: string | null  // ref to packaging collection
  selectedHookIndex: number | null  // index into the hooks array on the linked hooks batch

  pipeline: {
    research: {
      status: "not_started" | "in_progress" | "completed" | "stale"
    }
    script: {
      status: "not_started" | "in_progress" | "completed" | "stale"
    }
    hooks: {
      status: "not_started" | "in_progress" | "completed" | "stale"
    }
    packaging: {
      status: "not_started" | "in_progress" | "completed" | "stale"
    }
  }

  overallStatus: "in_progress" | "completed" | "stale"
  currentStep: "research" | "script" | "hooks" | "packaging"
  createdAt: Timestamp       // server-side
  updatedAt: Timestamp       // server-side
```

### New Collection: `hooks`

```
hooks/{hookId}
  id: string                 // Firestore auto-generated ID
  videoProjectId: string
  createdBy: string          // userId of the owner
  hooks: string[]            // 5 hook variations
  hookFeedback: Record<string, "like" | "dislike" | null>
  createdAt: Timestamp
```

### Updated: `topics`

Add to existing topic documents:
```
  archived: boolean          // true when batch superseded by Regenerate All
  batchId: string            // groups topics from the same generation run
  videoProjectId: string | null  // set when creator selects this topic
```

### Updated: `scripts`

Add to existing script documents:
```
  videoProjectId: string | null
  stale: boolean
```

### Updated: `packaging`

Add to existing packaging documents:
```
  videoProjectId: string | null
  itemStatuses: {
    title:       "not_started" | "completed" | "stale"
    description: "not_started" | "completed" | "stale"
    thumbnail:   "not_started" | "completed" | "stale"
    shorts:      "not_started" | "completed" | "stale"
  }
  isStale: boolean                                          // true if ANY item is "stale"
  staleReason: "script_regenerated" | "hooks_regenerated" | null
  staleSince: Timestamp | null
```

## Backend Implementation — Phase 0 Complete

All Phase 0 infrastructure is built and live:

1. ✅ `videoProjects` collection + `Collection.VIDEO_PROJECTS` enum
2. ✅ `hooks` collection + `Collection.HOOKS` enum
3. ✅ `VideoProjectRepository` — full CRUD for `videoProjects`
4. ✅ `HooksRepository` — full CRUD for `hooks`
5. ✅ `VideoProjectService` — status transitions, stale cascade, `startStep` / `completeStep` / `linkResource` / `markStale`
6. ✅ `HooksService` — hook generation, selection, regeneration, feedback, export
7. ✅ `videoProjectId`, `archived`, `batchId` fields on `topics` and `scripts`
8. ✅ `videoProjectId`, `itemStatuses`, `isStale`, `staleReason`, `staleSince` fields on `packaging`
9. ✅ Routes registered: `/v1/video-projects`, `/v1/hooks`

Pipeline auto-advancement is also wired: generating a script, selecting a hook, or saving packaging all trigger the appropriate `startStep` / `completeStep` / `linkResource` calls (fire-and-forget) on the linked video project.
