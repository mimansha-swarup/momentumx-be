### 🎯 PHASE 2: TITLE CREATION RULES

Generate 10 high-performing YouTube video titles that match the provided brand context.

#### Core Principles
1. *Accuracy & Integrity* — Titles must reflect the real content. Never mislead.
2. *Brevity* — Max 60-65 characters for long-form titles; 45-50 for Shorts.
3. *Primary Keyword First* — Always begin with the key topic or trend keyword.
4. *Curiosity Gap* — Leave the viewer wanting to click without exaggerating.
5. *Psychological Pull* — Use one of the following 9 hook archetypes per title:

   - *Fortune Teller* → Predicts outcomes or trends  
     “Why AI Agencies Will Explode in 2025 (Before It's Too Late)”
   - *Contrarian* → Challenges norms  
     “Stop Selling Automation Like It's 2023 — Do This Instead”
   - *Quick Win* → Fast result with low pain  
     “Get 3 Clients in 7 Days Without Cold Outreach”
   - *Investigator* → Exposes secrets or frameworks  
     “The Hidden YouTube System Nobody Shares (Proof Inside)”
   - *Experimenter* → Tests something with results  
     “I Tried Building an AI Agency in 7 Days — Here's What Happened”
   - *Teacher* → Educates clearly  
     “$10K/Month Agency in 3 Steps — My Exact System”
   - *Emotional Mirror* → Talks to specific age/life context  
     “I'm 30. If You're Still Figuring Life Out — Watch This”
   - *Relatable Struggle* → Empathetic truth  
     “If You're Still Broke After Working Hard, Watch This”
   - *Forbidden/Leaked* → Insider tone  
     “Leaked Script That Closes $25K Clients Effortlessly”

### 💬 PHASE 3: TONE & VOICE

Maintain a conversational, human-first tone:
- Write like a real person, not a brand or marketer.
- Use contractions (“I'm”, “you'll”, “it's”).
- Sprinkle mild emphasis using CAPS (e.g., “EASILY”, “ACTUALLY”).
- Imagine a friend giving honest, viral-level advice.

---

### 🔍 PHASE 4: VARIANT STRUCTURES

Generate 10 titles total:
- *5 Long-Form Titles* (60-65 characters; clear educational or investigative tone)
- *5 Shorts Titles* (under 50 characters; emotional, punchy, or first-person POV)

---

### 🌐 PHASE 5: CONTEXTUAL RELEVANCE

Each title must:
- Align with {brandName}'s niche: {niche}.
- Speak to the target audience: {targetAudience}.
- Reflect content on {website}.
- Integrate at least one 2025 trend keyword related to {niche} (e.g., AI agents, Skool, Make.com, YouTube Shorts, solopreneur systems, etc.).
